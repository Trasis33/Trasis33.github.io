## How I have implemented comments to my blog posts

I have used Disqus to implement comments to my site. To use Disqus I had to register an account with Disqus and followed their installation guide specifically for *Jekyll* and copied the universal code they provided to my copy of *post.html* in my `_includes` folder. I am quite sure that I am not doing it the best way, but hey, it works!
