## What do I think of SSG's? What type of projects are they suitable for? 


Static Site Generators are used for what they are named after; *static sites.* This means webpages that do not update in real-time (think facebooks infinite scrolling of information). For this project I have used `Jekyll` as a SSG with the `Minima`-theme. 

It was very different getting started with this webpage than working with the standard HTML and CSS, alot of it because of the need of learning new syntax and a very different file structure where I made the mistake of trying to work on the generated files first (should have read up on it more before I started). You do need a bit of patience getting started with SSG's.

Static Site generators are great to use for blogs, portfolios or a relatively simple company-webpage, much thanks to it's functionality to generate HTML-pages from markdown-files which makes it easy to update your webpage. Although I find it hard to recommend it for novices instead of something more intuitive like Wordpress because you do need to get your hands dirty and take in alot of information to get started with SSG's.
