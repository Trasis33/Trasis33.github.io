## What do I think of pre-compiling my CSS? How does it compare to regular CSS?


First of all, I'm a firm believer of *if it isn't broken, don't fix it,* and sure, CSS has it's problems but it works. Secondly, CSS pre-compilers do actually have some good ideas to them, like the ability to use functions or dividing the code between several files for greater organization and let the pre-compiler compile them all to a standard CSS file.

Using variables is also a nice feature, although it has since been implemented into standard CSS but with different syntax. It's nice to just change the font in one place and have it change across the entire site, or name a fixed color to be used anywhere.

I had a hard time getting started with Sass, because whatever i did, it VSCode would not let me type in Sass-syntax as it was shown on Sass' website. Also it was sometimes hard to tell the difference and knowing if I was using Sass or just regular CSS. Knowing the ins and outs of Sass is still something I need to work on.
