My name is Fredrik Lang√• and I study at LNU in Kalmar, Sweden. I'm currently studying the first year of 
the *Web Programming*-course.

I love almost everything tech-related; computers, gadgets, gaming, peripherals (mice, keyboards etc, it's an *addiction*), RGB all the things, aaaand stuff like that. My second hobby which was previously my passion is music. I previously wrote and produced alot of music, but things happen and now it plays second fiddle to studying.
